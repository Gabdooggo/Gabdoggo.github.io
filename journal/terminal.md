# My journey learning in terminal.
Terminal is hard but very interesting. I want to learn html code. I also want to make a lot of websites and I want to add pictures to my website. 
Learning the terminal was hard at first but now I think im getting it. Its probably going to get a lot harder though but so far its been fun. Chris made Vim seem like the hardest website to learn so I was scared but Vim isn't really that hard, at least in my opinion. Vim is also very useful since it can create files and folders, and other websites as well. So I'm excited for it.
